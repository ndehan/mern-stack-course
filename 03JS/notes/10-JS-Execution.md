# Lecture 10: JS Code Execution

## **The Fundamental Problem: Computers are Not Smart**

The most important thing to remember is that a computer's processor (CPU) doesn't understand JavaScript. It only understands one thing: **Machine Code** (sequences of 1s and 0s).

Our goal is to translate the human-friendly JavaScript we write into machine-friendly instructions. This translation job is done by the **JavaScript Engine**.

**The JavaScript Engine:** A program that reads, translates, and executes JavaScript code. The most famous one is Google's **V8**, which powers Chrome and Node.js.

### **The Engine's Two Core Components**

To manage our code, the engine sets up two primary areas in memory:

1. **The Memory Heap:** A large, unstructured pool of memory. Think of it as a giant warehouse where all the "things" (objects, arrays, and most importantly, functions) from your code are stored.
2. **The Call Stack:** A highly organized, temporary workspace. Think of it as a to-do list where you can only add tasks to the top and can only work on the topmost task. It's responsible for managing which function is currently running.

### **The Two-Phase Process: The Secret to "Hoisting"**

The engine does not just read your code from top to bottom and run it. For any piece of code (the global script, a function), it performs a two-phase process.

1. **Creation Phase (Memory Setup):** The engine takes a quick first pass through the code. It doesn't execute anything. Its only job is to find all the variable and function declarations and set aside memory for them.
2. **Execution Phase (Doing the Work):** After the setup is complete, the engine takes a second pass to actually execute the code: assigning values to variables, calling functions, and running the logic.

This two-phase process is what creates the effect we call **hoisting**.

### **A Detailed Walkthrough: From Code to Console**

Let's trace the following code step-by-step to see every part of the process.

**Our Code Example:**

```jsx
// script.js
var score = 50;
const playerName = "Alex";

function calculateBonus(currentScore) {
    var bonus = currentScore / 10;
    return bonus;
}

var finalScore = score + calculateBonus(score);
console.log(finalScore);

```

### **Step 0: The "Before You Run" Phase (Compilation)**

Before anything else, the V8 engine takes our `script.js` file and compiles it.

1. **Parsing:** The code is read and turned into a data structure called an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
2. **Compilation:** The AST is then compiled into **Bytecode**. This is a low-level set of instructions that the engine can execute very quickly. This bytecode is loaded into a special, executable area of memory called the **Code Space**.

The engine will not be reading our text file during execution; it will be running this highly optimized bytecode.

### **Step 1: Global Execution - The Creation Phase**

The engine is now ready to run the global part of our script. It starts with the creation phase.

1. A **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created. This is the main environment for our script. It is pushed onto the **Call Stack**.
2. The engine scans the global code for declarations:
    - `var score;`: Finds this. In the GEC's memory, it creates a property `score` and initializes it with `undefined`.
    - `const playerName;`: Finds this. It creates a `playerName` binding but leaves it in an **uninitialized** state. This is the start of its **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**.
    - `function calculateBonus(...)`: Finds this. This is special.
        - A complete **Function Object** is created on the **Memory Heap**. This object contains the function's metadata and, crucially, a pointer to its executable bytecode in the Code Space.
        - In the GEC's memory, a property `calculateBonus` is created and is immediately initialized with a pointer to that object on the Heap.
    - `var finalScore;`: Finds this. Creates a `finalScore` property and initializes it with `undefined`.

**Memory State After Global Creation:**

- **Call Stack:** `[ GEC ]`
- **Global Memory:** `score: undefined`, `playerName: <uninitialized>`, `calculateBonus: <pointer to Heap>`, `finalScore: undefined`
- **Heap:** Contains the `calculateBonus` Function Object.

### **Step 2: Global Execution - The Execution Phase**

The engine now executes the global bytecode instructions.

- `var score = 50;`
    - The value `50` is assigned to `score` in global memory.
- `const playerName = "Alex";`
    - The value `"Alex"` is assigned to `playerName`. Its TDZ is now over.
- `function calculateBonus(...)`
    - This is a declaration. It was fully handled in the creation phase, so the engine skips it.
- `var finalScore = score + calculateBonus(score);`
    - This is the most important line. The engine needs to resolve this expression from right to left.
    - It first needs to execute `calculateBonus(score)`.
    - It looks up `score` in global memory and gets its value, `50`.
    - It prepares to call `calculateBonus` with the argument `50`. **The execution of the global code is now paused.**

### **Step 3: The Function Call - `calculateBonus(50)`**

This is where the Call Stack comes into play.

1. **A new Function Execution Context (FEC)** is created for this specific call.
2. Before jumping to the function's code, the engine creates a **"bookmark"**. It takes the memory address of the **next bytecode instruction** needed to complete the `var finalScore = ...` line and stores this **Return Address** inside the new FEC.
3. The FEC is **pushed onto the top of the Call Stack**.
4. **FEC Creation Phase:**
    - The engine creates a local environment for this function.
    - The parameter `currentScore` is created as a local variable and initialized with the passed value, `50`.
    - The engine scans the function's code for declarations: it finds `var bonus;`. A local variable `bonus` is created and initialized with `undefined`.
5. **FEC Execution Phase:** The engine now executes the function's bytecode.
    - `var bonus = currentScore / 10;`: It looks up `currentScore` (finds `50` locally), calculates `50 / 10 = 5`, and assigns `5` to the local variable `bonus`.
    - `return bonus;`: The function needs to return. It looks up the value of `bonus` (which is `5`).

**Visualizing the Call Stack at its Deepest Point:**

```
     TOP
+------------------------------+
| calculateBonus() Exec. Context | <-- We are executing here
| - Return Address: <to line 8>  |
| - Local Memory:              |
|   - currentScore: 50         |
|   - bonus: 5                 |
+------------------------------+
| Global Execution Context       | <-- This is paused
| - Global Memory:             |
|   - score: 50                |
|   - ...                      |
+------------------------------+

```

### **Step 4: The Return**

1. The `calculateBonus` function is finished. It packages up the return value, `5`.
2. The engine looks at the current FEC, finds the **Return Address** ("the bookmark"), and prepares to jump back.
3. The **FEC is popped from the Call Stack**. All of its local variables (`currentScore`, `bonus`) are instantly destroyed. The memory is cleaned up.
4. The engine's Program Counter is set to the retrieved Return Address.

### **Step 5: Resuming Global Execution**

- Execution is now back on the line `var finalScore = ...`.
- The expression has been resolved to `50 + 5`.
- The engine calculates `55` and assigns this value to `finalScore` in global memory.
- `console.log(finalScore);`
    - This is another function call. A new FEC for `console.log` is pushed to the stack.
    - It looks up `finalScore` (gets `55`), performs its job of printing to the console.
    - The `console.log` FEC is popped from the stack.

The script is now finished. The GEC is popped from the Call Stack, and the program ends.

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Code is Compiled First:** Your JavaScript text is transformed into optimized Bytecode before it runs.
2. **Creation Before Execution:** Memory is set aside for variables and functions *before* the code is executed. This is why function declarations can be called before they appear in the code.
3. **The Call Stack Manages Flow:** The Call Stack keeps track of which function is currently running. Every function call creates a new, temporary, isolated environment (an Execution Context).
4. **The Stack is for "Who" and "Where":** It holds the execution contexts and the "return addresses" (bookmarks) to manage the flow of the program.
5. **The Heap is for "What":** It holds the actual objects and functions, which can live on long after the function that created them has finished.

## Hoisting

### The Misleading Idea (The Lie)

The common explanation is: "Hoisting is when JavaScript moves your variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before execution."

This is a lie. Nothing is physically moved. Forgetting this lie is the first step to truly understanding.

### The Real Mechanism (The Truth)

The truth is that JavaScript code runs in two phases (or passes):

1. **Creation Phase (Memory Setup):** Before executing any code, the JavaScript engine reads through your code and sets aside memory for all the variables and functions it finds. This is like a chef doing *mise en place*â€”getting all the ingredients ready before starting to cook.
2. **Execution Phase (Doing the Work):** After setting up memory, the engine goes back through the code line by line and actually executes it (assigns values, calls functions, etc.).

**Hoisting is simply the visible effect of this two-phase process.** Because the engine already knows about your variables and functions from the first pass, it feels like they were "hoisted" to the top.

### The Unforgettable Analogy: The Teacher and the Roster

Imagine a teacher (the JavaScript Engine) walking into a classroom (your code's scope).

The teacher does two things:

1. **Takes Attendance (Creation Phase):** Before starting the lesson, the teacher takes out the class roster and reads all the students' names. They now *know which students are supposed to be in the class*.
2. **Teaches the Lesson (Execution Phase):** The teacher starts teaching from the first page of the textbook to the last.

Now, let's see how `var`, `let`, `const`, and `function` behave like different types of students during the **"Attendance" phase**.

### 1. Function Declarations: The Eager Student

```jsx
// You ask the teacher about the student before the lesson starts
console.log(sayHello()); // "Hello!"

function sayHello() {
  return "Hello!";
}

```

- **Attendance (Creation Phase):** The teacher sees `function sayHello` on the roster. This student is so eager, they are **already in their seat and have their homework done**. The teacher marks them as "Present and Ready."
- **Result:** You can ask about this student (`call the function`) even before the lesson gets to their page, because the teacher already knows everything about them.

---

### 2. `var` Declarations: The Absent Student with a Reserved Desk

```jsx
// You ask about the student's homework
console.log(studentName); // undefined

var studentName = "Alice";

console.log(studentName); // "Alice"

```

- **Attendance (Creation Phase):** The teacher sees `var studentName` on the roster. The teacher knows this student exists, so they reserve a desk for them, but the student isn't actually here yet. The teacher marks their status as "Absent" (which in JavaScript is `undefined`).
- **Result:** If you ask about `studentName` before the lesson reaches their line, the teacher will tell you their status: "Absent" (`undefined`). They won't say "I don't know who that is" (`ReferenceError`). They know the student exists, but they have no value yet.

---

### 3. `let` and `const` Declarations: The Late Student (Strict Rule)

```jsx
// You ask about the student
console.log(score); // Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'score' before initialization

let score = 100;

```

- **Attendance (Creation Phase):** The teacher sees `let score` on the roster. The teacher knows this student is supposed to be in the class, but has a very strict rule: **"No one is allowed to talk about this student or ask for their homework until they physically walk through the classroom door."** This period of time before they arrive is the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**.
- **Result:** If you ask about `score` before the lesson reaches its line, the teacher (JS Engine) doesn't just say they're absent. They stop the entire class and give you a `ReferenceError`. You broke the strict rule.

### The Final, Memorable Definition

Forget the "moving code" idea. Remember this instead:

> Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of knowing about a variable or function's existence before executing the code. How it treats that knowledge depends on the keyword (function, var, let, or const).
> 
- **`function`:** Hoisted completely (name and body).
- **`var`:** Hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
- **`let`/`const`:** Hoisted, but not initialized. They are put in a Temporal Dead Zone.
