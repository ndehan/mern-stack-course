# Lecture 07: Array in javascript

## **Part 1: The Core Concept & Creation**

**First Thought: An array is a numbered, ordered list of items.**

Think of it like a list of high scores, a grocery list, or a train with numbered cars. Each item has a specific position.

**A. Creating an Array**
The simplest and most common way is using square brackets `[]`.

```jsx
// An empty array (an empty list)
let emptyList = [];

// An array of numbers
let scores = [98, 85, 100, 92];

// An array of strings
let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

// An array can hold different data types
let mixedData = [10, "hello", true, null];

```

**B. The `.length` Property**
Every array has a `.length` property that tells you how many items are in it.

```jsx
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(fruits.length); // 3

```

This property is automatically updated when you add or remove items.

**C. Accessing and Changing Elements (Zero-Based Indexing)**
To read or change an item, you use its position number, called an **index**.

**CRITICAL RULE:** Array indexing in JavaScript starts at **0**.

- The 1st item is at index `0`.
- The 2nd item is at index `1`.
- ...and so on.

```jsx
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
// Index:      0        1         2

// Accessing (reading) an element
console.log(fruits[0]); // "Apple"

// Changing (writing) an element
fruits[1] = "Blueberry";
console.log(fruits); // ["Apple", "Blueberry", "Cherry"]

// Getting the last element
console.log(fruits[fruits.length - 1]); // "Cherry"

```

If you try to access an index that doesn't exist, you get `undefined`.

## **Part 2: Basic Array Modification (Mutating the Array)**

These methods **change the original array**.

**A. Adding/Removing from the END of the Array**
These are the most common and efficient modification methods.

- **`.push(item1, item2, ...)`:** Adds one or more items to the end.
- **`.pop()`:** Removes the last item and gives it back to you.

```jsx
let tasks = ["Wash dishes"];
tasks.push("Do laundry", "Buy groceries");
console.log(tasks); // ["Wash dishes", "Do laundry", "Buy groceries"]

let completedTask = tasks.pop();
console.log(completedTask); // "Buy groceries"
console.log(tasks);       // ["Wash dishes", "Do laundry"]

```

**B. Adding/Removing from the BEGINNING of the Array**

- **`.unshift(item1, item2, ...)`:** Adds one or more items to the beginning.
- **`.shift()`:** Removes the first item and gives it back to you.

```jsx
let queue = ["Person B", "Person C"];
queue.unshift("Person A");
console.log(queue); // ["Person A", "Person B", "Person C"]

let firstInLine = queue.shift();
console.log(firstInLine); // "Person A"
console.log(queue);     // ["Person B", "Person C"]

```

*(Note: `unshift` and `shift` can be slower on very large arrays because every other element needs to be shifted to a new position.)*

---

## **Part 3: Looping Over an Array (Iteration)**

To perform an action on every item in the list, you use a loop.

**A. The Classic `for` Loop**
This is the most fundamental way to iterate. You create a counter variable (`i`) that tracks the index.

```jsx
let scores = [98, 85, 100];
let total = 0;

// The loop runs as long as `i` is less than the array's length.
for (let i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {
  console.log(`Processing score at index ${i}: ${scores[i]}`);
  total = total + scores[i];
}

console.log(`The total score is: ${total}`); // 283

```

**B. The `for...of` Loop (The Modern, Simpler Way)**
This is the preferred method when you only care about the **value** of each item and not its index. It's cleaner and less error-prone.

```jsx
let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

for (const name of names) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

```

---

## **Part 4: Advanced Array Manipulation**

**A. The `splice()` Method (The "Surgery" Tool)**
This is a powerful **mutating** method that can add, remove, or replace elements anywhere in the array.

**Syntax:** `array.splice(startIndex, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)`

```jsx
let months = ["Jan", "March", "April", "June"];

// Example 1: REMOVING "March"
// Start at index 1, delete 1 element.
months.splice(1, 1);
console.log(months); // ["Jan", "April", "June"]

// Example 2: ADDING "Feb"
// Start at index 1, delete 0 elements, and add "Feb".
months.splice(1, 0, "Feb");
console.log(months); // ["Jan", "Feb", "April", "June"]

// Example 3: REPLACING "April" with "May"
// Start at index 2, delete 1 element, and add "May".
months.splice(2, 1, "May");
console.log(months); // ["Jan", "Feb", "May", "June"]

```

**B. The `slice()` Method (Making a Copy)**
This method creates a **new array** by copying a portion of an existing array. It does **not** change the original.

**Syntax:** `array.slice(startIndex, endIndex)` (end index is not included)

```jsx
let animals = ["ant", "bison", "camel", "duck", "elephant"];

// Copy the elements from index 2 up to (but not including) index 4
let middleAnimals = animals.slice(2, 4);
console.log(middleAnimals); // ["camel", "duck"]

// If you omit the end index, it copies to the end of the array.
let allButFirstTwo = animals.slice(2);
console.log(allButFirstTwo); // ["camel", "duck", "elephant"]

// A common way to make a full copy of an array:
let fullCopy = animals.slice();

console.log(animals); // The original is unchanged!

```

**C. The Spread Operator (`...`) (The Modern Way to Copy/Combine)**
This is the most popular way in modern JavaScript to create copies or merge arrays.

```jsx
const arr1 = ["a", "b"];
const arr2 = ["c", "d"];

// Make a copy
const copyOfArr1 = [...arr1];
console.log(copyOfArr1); // ["a", "b"]

// Combine two arrays
const combined = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(combined); // ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

// Add elements in the middle
const withMiddle = [...arr1, "x", "y", ...arr2];
console.log(withMiddle); // ["a", "b", "x", "y", "c", "d"]

```

## **Part 5: Converting and Searching**

**A. Array to String Conversion**

- **`.join(separator)`:** Joins all elements of an array into a single string. You can specify what to put between them.
    
    ```jsx
    const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
    const nameList = names.join(", ");
    console.log(nameList); // "Alice, Bob, Charlie"
    
    ```
    

**B. Simple Searching**

- **`.indexOf(item)`:** Returns the index of the **first** time an item appears in the array. Returns `1` if not found.
- **`.lastIndexOf(item)`:** Returns the index of the **last** time an item appears.
- **`.includes(item)`:** Returns `true` or `false` if an item exists. This is often the simplest and most readable choice for a simple check.

```jsx
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 20, 40];

console.log(numbers.indexOf(20));    // 1 (the first occurrence)
console.log(numbers.lastIndexOf(20)); // 3 (the last occurrence)
console.log(numbers.indexOf(99));    // -1

console.log(numbers.includes(30));   // true
console.log(numbers.includes(99));   // false

```

## **Advanced Array Methods: Sorting, Flattening, and Deleting**

### Sorting Arrays: The `.sort()` Method

The `.sort()` method sorts the elements of an array **in place**â€”meaning it **mutates (changes) the original array**.

**First Thought: "I have a shuffled list. I want to put it in order."**

This sounds simple, but `.sort()` has a default behavior that is often **not what you want.**

**A. The Default Sort (The "Dictionary" Sort)**
By default, with no arguments, `.sort()` converts all elements to **strings** and sorts them in lexicographical (dictionary) order based on their UTF-16 character codes.

This works fine for strings:

```jsx
let fruits = ["Cherry", "Apple", "Banana"];
fruits.sort();
console.log(fruits); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"] (This works as expected)

```

**CRITICAL GOTCHA:** This default behavior is a disaster for numbers.

```jsx
let numbers = [100, 2, 5, 25, 1];
numbers.sort();

// The numbers are converted to strings: "100", "2", "5", "25", "1"
// The sort then compares them character by character:
// "1" comes before "100"
// "100" comes before "2"
// "2" comes before "25"

console.log(numbers); // [1, 100, 2, 25, 5] (This is WRONG!)

```

Because `"100"` starts with a `"1"`, the dictionary sort places it before `"2"`.

**B. The Correct Way to Sort: The Compare Function**
To sort anything other than simple strings, you **must** provide a **compare function** as an argument to `.sort()`.

The compare function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which represent two elements from the array being compared. It must return a number with a specific meaning:

- **If it returns a negative number (`< 0`):** `a` should come **before** `b`.
- **If it returns a positive number (`> 0`):** `a` should come **after** `b`.
- **If it returns `0`:** `a` and `b` are considered equal, and their order doesn't change relative to each other.

**C. Sorting Numbers Correctly**
This is where the formula `(a, b) => a - b` comes in. It's a brilliant and concise way to implement the compare function for numerical sorting.

**Let's analyze `(a, b) => a - b` for ascending order (smallest to largest):**

- **Case 1:** Let's say `a` is `5` and `b` is `10`.
    - `a - b` is `5 - 10 = -5` (a negative number).
    - The rule says: if negative, `a` comes before `b`. This is correct.
- **Case 2:** Let's say `a` is `25` and `b` is `2`.
    - `a - b` is `25 - 2 = 23` (a positive number).
    - The rule says: if positive, `a` comes after `b`. This is correct.
- **Case 3:** Let's say `a` is `100` and `b` is `100`.
    - `a - b` is `100 - 100 = 0`.
    - The rule says: if zero, the order doesn't matter. This is correct.

**The Code in Action:**

```jsx
let numbers = [100, 2, 5, 25, 1];

// Sort in ascending order
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 5, 25, 100] (Correct!)

// To sort in descending order, just flip the subtraction.
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(numbers); // [100, 25, 5, 2, 1] (Correct!)

```

### Flattening Arrays: The `.flat()` Method (ES2019)

An array can contain other arrays, creating a nested or "multi-dimensional" array. The `.flat()` method is used to "flatten" this structure.

**First Thought: "I have a list of lists. I just want one single, long list."**

`.flat()` creates a **new array** by pulling out all the items from the sub-arrays. It is **non-mutating**.

**A. Basic Flattening (One Level Deep)**
By default, `.flat()` only goes one level deep.

```jsx
const nestedArray = [1, 2, [3, 4]];
const flattened = nestedArray.flat();

console.log(flattened);   // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(nestedArray); // [1, 2, [3, 4]] (Original is unchanged)

```

**B. Flattening Multiple Levels**
You can provide a number as an argument to tell `.flat()` how many levels deep it should go.

```jsx
const deeplyNested = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]];

// Go two levels deep
const flatTwoLevels = deeplyNested.flat(2);
console.log(flatTwoLevels); // [1, 2, 3, [4]]

// To flatten completely, no matter how deep, you can use Infinity.
const completelyFlat = deeplyNested.flat(Infinity);
console.log(completelyFlat); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

```

`.flat()` also automatically removes empty slots in sparse arrays.

### Deleting Elements in an Array

There are several ways to "delete" an element, and they have very different results.

**Method 1: `.pop()` or `.shift()` (The Cleanest Way)**
If you want to remove an element from the beginning or end of an array, these are the best methods. They remove the element and automatically update the `.length`.

**Method 2: `.splice()` (The Most Versatile Way)**
As we saw before, `splice` is perfect for removing one or more elements from anywhere in the array. It cleanly removes the elements and re-indexes the array. This is the **recommended way to delete from the middle of an array.**

```jsx
let items = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
// Remove "c" (at index 2)
items.splice(2, 1);
console.log(items); // ["a", "b", "d"]
console.log(items.length); // 3

```

**Method 3: The `delete` Operator (The "Bad" Way - Avoid)**
You can use the `delete` operator on an array element, but you should **almost never do this.**

**First Thought: "This seems easy, I'll just delete it."**
But it doesn't do what you think. It removes the element's value but leaves an **empty, "hole"** in its place. It does **not** update the array's length or re-index the other elements.

```jsx
let letters = ["a", "b", "c"];
delete letters[1]; // "Delete" the element at index 1

console.log(letters);       // ["a", empty, "c"]
console.log(letters[1]);    // undefined
console.log(letters.length); // 3 (The length did NOT change!)

```

This creates a **sparse array** with a "hole" in it, which can cause unexpected behavior in loops and with other array methods.

**Conclusion on Deleting:**

- To remove from the end, use `.pop()`.
- To remove from the beginning, use `.shift()`.
- To remove from the middle, **use `.splice()`**.
- **Never use the `delete` operator on an array.**

## Why array is not array in javascript

### The C++ Array: A Row of Houses

Imagine a new street is built. The government says, "This street will have 10 houses, they will all be identical two-bedroom houses, and they will be built side-by-side in an unbroken row."

1. **Contiguous Memory:** This is the solid foundation. A C++ array (`int arr[10];`) is a single, continuous, unbroken block of memory. Every slot physically exists.
2. **Homogeneous (Identical Houses):** Every element must be the same type (`int`). This is because every house must be the same size, so the city knows how to find them.
3. **Mathematical Access:** To get to House #7, you don't search. You do a simple calculation: `(Address of House #0) + (7 * size_of_one_house)`. This is why it is **blindingly fast**.
4. **No Gaps:** You cannot have House #1 and House #7 without also having houses #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6 physically built in between.

This is a true, low-level array. It is a memory layout.

---

### The JavaScript Array: A Wall of P.O. Boxes

Now, imagine a post office. The wall has slots for boxes numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on.

1. **It's an Object (The Wall of Boxes):** A JavaScript `Array` is fundamentally an **object**. The "indices" (`0`, `1`, `2`) are not memory offsets; they are **property keys**, just like `"name"` or `"age"` in a regular object. The only difference is that the keys look like numbers.
2. **Can be Sparse (No Gaps Needed):** This is the most powerful proof. You can have P.O. Box #0 and P.O. Box #1000. You do **not** need to build the 999 empty boxes in between. The "empty" slots don't actually exist in memory.
    
    **The Code Proof:**
    
    ```jsx
    let jsArray = [];
    jsArray[0] = "first item";
    jsArray[1000] = "last item";
    
    console.log(jsArray.length); // Outputs: 1001
    console.log(jsArray[500]);   // Outputs: undefined
    
    ```
    
    A C++ array would have crashed your program here. The JavaScript array is fine. It's just an object that now has two properties, `"0"` and `"1000"`, and its `.length` property was automatically updated to `highest_index + 1`. The 999 "empty" slots are just non-existent properties.
    
3. **Heterogeneous (Different Sized Boxes):** You can put a tiny letter in Box #0, a large package in Box #1, and a key in Box #2. Each box can hold a different type of thing.
    
    **The Code Proof:**
    
    ```jsx
    let mixedArray = [10, "hello", true, { id: 1 }];
    
    ```
    
    This is possible because the array is just an object storing values (or references to values) against keys. A C++ array could never do this because all the "houses" in its contiguous block of memory must be the same size.
    
4. **Property Lookup (Not Math):** To get the item at index `1000`, the engine isn't doing a mathematical calculation. It's performing a **property lookup** on an object, just as if you were asking for `user["name"]`. It's looking for a property with the key `"1000"`.

### The Final Piece of Evidence: How V8 Optimizes It

"If it's just a slow object, why are JavaScript arrays so fast?"

This is where the magic of modern JavaScript engines like V8 comes in. V8 is incredibly smart. It knows that developers *want* arrays to be fast. So, it has an optimization system:

1. **The Fast Path:** When you create a simple, dense, homogeneous array (like `[1, 2, 3, 4]`), V8 will say, "Aha! This *looks* like a real C++ array." Behind the scenes, it **will** store it in a contiguous block of memory for maximum speed.
2. **The "De-optimization" Trigger:** The moment you do something that breaks the "row of houses" rule, V8 gives up on the optimization and switches back to the slower, more flexible "post office box" (object/hash map) storage. Triggers include:
    - Making the array sparse: `myArray[500] = '...';`
    - Adding mixed types: `myArray.push({});`
    - Deleting an element from the middle: `delete myArray[1];`

### Conclusion: Why is a JavaScript Array not a "real" array?

| Feature | True Array (C++) | JavaScript Array |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Underlying Structure** | A contiguous block of memory | A specialized **Object** with number-like keys |
| **Elements** | Must be the same type (homogeneous) | Can be different types (heterogeneous) |
| **Memory Layout** | Dense (no gaps allowed) | Can be **sparse** (can have huge gaps) |
| **Access Method** | Fast mathematical offset calculation | Slower property/key lookup (but heavily optimized) |

A JavaScript array is not a fundamental memory structure; it is a **high-level data structure** implemented as an object, which has been given a special `.length` property and an array-like prototype to make it *behave* like an array for the developer's convenience.
